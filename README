# About

Provides an interface between TiddlyWeb and the node.js wikifier for TiddlyWiki text.
When a request is made to render a tiddler with TiddlyWiki text it is passed on to a node.js module for processing.
It then returns the result back to the client that requested it.

# Requirements

* [Python](http://www.python.org/)
* make
* A working TiddlyWeb instance to test against
* [py.test](http://pytest.org/latest/) to run the tests.

# Contributing

`setup.py` is used to package up the plugin and install it.

Plugin code lives in the `tiddlywebplugins` directory.

Tests live in the `test` directory.

# Usage

`make test` runs the tests.  Currently there is just the one that
ensures the plugin can be imported.

`make install` installs the plugin as a package on your system
(you may need sudo for this.)
You can then reference the plugin from your TiddlyWeb configuration
as a system plugin e.g:

`system_plugins': ['tiddlywebplugins.twikified']`

If you wish to use this with [Tiddlypace](https://github.com/TiddlySpace/tiddlyspace)
make sure you declare the plugin in the configuration file _before_ the
tiddlywebplugins.tiddlyspace plugin e.g:

`'system_plugins': ['tiddlywebplugins.twikified', 'tiddlywebplugins.tiddlyspace']`
